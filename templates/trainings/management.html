                     As the author William Gibson <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson" target="_blank">said</a>: "The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed." For the last few years, the Construction Industry has seen a number of innovations. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is among the ones that changed the way we, as architects, approach our everyday work, giving BIM a sort of 'disruptive technology' status. And for a good reason.

                    <p class="about-p">                
                     While it may seem as though the jury is still out on whether BIM is a necessity, a useful but difficult tool to implement or a sheer luxury for architectural practices, in reality, the big leaders in our field already made the transition to BIM - despite the challenges. And while they were able to offset the issues that accompany the task of enforcing new practices in a big scale with hiring the right people in good numbers, that may not be the case for micro and small practices. On the flip side, the smaller the practice, the fewer machine parts there are to move.
