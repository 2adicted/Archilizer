			<i>
			 "I have always been passionate for computer science and its application in the field of Architecture. As an early adopter of BIM (2009), I have evangelized its potential and use through trainings, lectures and above all - by personally showcasing its ability to automate staple processes of the design workflow, thus increasing precision, accuracy and efficiency and allowing us, architects, to spend more time in what matters most - designing."</i>
			</p>	
			<p class="about-p">We are focused on creating and implementing robust solutions by developing custom algorithms with various application in the design process. We also engage in computational in nature design projects - we have won several competitions in urban prototyping and have exhibited in V&A London.
